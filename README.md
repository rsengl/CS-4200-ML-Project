The link to the dataset used for the code and the graphs is as follows:

First, we have the effect of additional car spaces on housing prices:

It is clear that as the number of car spaces increases, the price of the house also increases. 

The affect of rooms on housing prices by type, where h is a house, cottage, villa, semi, or terrace, u is a unit or duplex, and t is a townhouse:

Out of all of the housing types, we can see that for a house, cottage, villa, semi, or terrace, the prices seem to be the highest and the unit or duplex prices seem to be the lowest. However, out of all the housing types, as the rooms increase, the price also increases.

The affect of distance to a central business district:

It appears that as the distance to a central business district is smaller, the price increases. This could be due to the lack of land in more urban areas.

The affect of building areas on price:

Generally, as the building area increases, the housing price increases. 

The bedroom affect on prices by area:

We can see that the housing prices are generally higher in the Southern Metropolitan Region and lower in the Northern Victoria, Western Victoria, and Eastern Victoria areas. However, across all areas as the number of bedrooms increase the price increases. The affect of additional bedrooms appears to be larger for the Southern Metropolitan area than other areas. 


The bathroom affect on price:

Generally, as the number of bathrooms increases, the housing price increases. 

The land amount affect on price:

We can se that there are larger housing prices for smaller areas of land rather than larger areas of land. 

Then, there are the following pair plots:
